A company may do this to raise capital for business expansion, debt repayment, or to invest in new projects. Preferred stocks are less dilutive of company ownership since they do not come with voting rights. They offer the issuing firm other benefits, not least because being less volatile makes them appeal to different investors. The fixed dividends also stabilize the company's balance sheet, making it more attractive to additional investors. Another reason is that, for some companies, the cost of issuing preferred stock is lower than issuing bonds. Unlike interest payments on bonds, dividends on preferred stock are not mandatory and generally are not tax-deductible for the corporation. However, they might still be less costly than the higher interest rates a company might have to pay to entice bond investors.\",\n",

A buyback is when a company uses its cash to purchase a portion of the company's outstanding equity shares. Buybacks reduce the overall share count and typically lead to a higher stock price. However, some companies buy back stock for a different reason: to disguise a decline in earnings per share (EPS), and they often borrow money to do so. By decreasing the number of shares outstanding, they can increase earnings per share even if the company's net income has declined.\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Index futures trading can be riskier than stock trading, especially when leverage is involved, which can amplify both gains and losses. While index futures offer diversification since they're based on a broad market index, their volatility and the potential for rapid financial changes heighten the risk. In contrast, stock trading allows investors to avoid inherent leverage, limiting losses to the invested amount. Hedging with futures, meant to offset risks in part of a portfolio, could lower your overall risk. Still, results can vary significantly based on market knowledge, experience, and the ability to manage leverage and diversification effectively.\",\n",

Traders look for signals from the closing price to predict the next day's market direction. A prominent method is the closing price reversion strategy, where, if a stock's closing price deviates significantly from its historical average, traders try to profit should it revert to the mean.

These figures can be found from the balance sheet of the last year and the end of the current year. During the current year, XYZ earns $200,000 in net income (found on the income statement for the end of the current year). Using the ROAE equation: Net income/ (Prior year shareholder equity + Current year shareholder value / 2), the result is $200,000/1,250,000= 16% gain.\",\n",

How much of the company you own depends on the number of shares the company has issued and the number of shares you own. If it's a small, private company, a single share could represent a large part of the company. Major public companies often have millions, even billions, of shares. For example, Apple Inc. (AAPL) has billions of shares in circulation, so a single share is just a tiny fraction of the company.\",\n",

This was changed to T+3 in 1993, shortening the prevailing practice at the time of settling securities transactions within five business days of trade date.

The effect is that in a winner-takes-all situation, the rich get richer and leave the rest behind. That is because stock markets and other winner-takes-all systems can be examples of zero-sum games, where winners must get ahead at the expense of the losers. There are alternative systems where an increase in wealth \\\"raises all ships\\\" where there is mutual benefit to gains instead of being zero-sum. Examples include countries with robust social welfare systems such as the Scandinavian countries. The potential downside is that those systems provide less overall potential benefit to winners since wealth is more evenly re-distributed among all.\",\n",
