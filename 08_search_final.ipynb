      "\n",
      "Year-over-Year (YoY) growth is a critical metric used in finance and economics to assess the performance of an economic variable over a specified period, typically one year. It allows analysts, policymakers, and investors to gauge the health of an economy, a specific sector, or a company by comparing current performance to that of the previous year. This metric is particularly useful for identifying trends, cyclical patterns, and the overall direction of growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Definition of YoY Growth**\n",
      "\n",
      "YoY growth expresses the percentage change in a variable (such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), revenue, or profit) from one year to the next. It provides a clear view of how much a particular variable has increased or decreased over a 12-month period, effectively smoothing out seasonal fluctuations that may distort shorter-term comparisons.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Calculation of YoY Growth**\n",
      "\n",
      "The calculation of YoY growth is straightforward and can be expressed mathematically as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\text{YoY Growth Rate} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Value at End of Current Period} - \\text{Value at End of Previous Period}}{\\text{Value at End of Previous Period}} \\right) \\times 100\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Steps to Calculate YoY Growth:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identify the Variable**: Determine the economic variable you wish to analyze (e.g., GDP, revenue, employment figures).\n",
