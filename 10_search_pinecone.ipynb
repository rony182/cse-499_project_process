      "Rising interest rates pose several risks to investors and the overall economy. Understanding these risks is crucial for making informed investment decisions and managing financial portfolios effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Bond Price Risk**: One of the primary risks associated with rising interest rates is bond price risk. When market interest rates increase, the prices of existing bonds typically decrease. This inverse relationship between bond prices and interest rates is known as interest rate risk. Investors holding fixed-income securities, such as bonds, face the risk of seeing the value of their investments decline if interest rates rise. This is particularly true for longer-term bonds, as they are more sensitive to changes in interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Inflation Risk**: Rising interest rates can also exacerbate inflation risk. While inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, rising interest rates may not keep pace with inflation, leading to a decrease in the real rate of return on investments. Investors may find that their returns do not adequately compensate for the increased cost of living, resulting in a loss of wealth in real terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cost of Borrowing**: Higher interest rates can increase the cost of borrowing for individuals, businesses, and governments. This can have a significant impact on various aspects of the economy, such as consumer spending, business investment, and government debt servicing. Increased borrowing costs can constrain economic growth and lead to reduced profitability for businesses that rely on credit to finance operations or expansion.\n",
